            <h2>History of Universiti Malaysia Terengganu</h2>
            <p>The Universiti Malaysia Terengganu (University of Malaysia, Terengganu) or UMT, formerly known as 
                Kolej Universiti Sains dan Teknologi Malaysia (Malaysian University College of Science and Technology) 
                or KUSTEM, is a university in Kuala Nerus District, Terengganu, Malaysia. It was officially chartered 
                on 1 February 2007.</p>
            <p>Universiti Malaysia Terengganu began as Universiti Pertanian Malaysia's 
                Centre for Fisheries and Marine Science, located at Mengabang Telipot, Kuala Terengganu.
                It provided facilities for both students and lecturers from the Fisheries and Marine Science 
                programmes to conduct their practical sessions and also researches.</p>
            <p>Eventually, the Faculty of Fisheries and Marine Science of Universiti Pertanian Malaysia (UPM) 
                in Serdang was transferred to Kuala Terengganu, and the Centre transformed into a branch campus, 
                being renamed Universiti Pertanian Malaysia Terengganu (UPMT) in June 1996. The name of the faculty 
                was also changed to the Faculty of Applied Sciences and Technology. Also formed were the 
                Faculty of Science and Professional Literature and the Matriculation Centre.</p>
